# PSRBackup

**PSRBackup** (PowerShell Restic Backup) is a PowerShell module that simplifies and automates Windows backups using [restic](https://restic.net/). It provides easy commands for initializing repositories, managing backup passwords securely, running backups with exclusions, and restoring data.

## Features

- 🚀 Initialize and manage restic repositories
- 🔐 Secure password storage using PowerShell SecretManagement
- 🚫 Exclude files/folders from backup via config/exclude.txt
- 📏 Pre-backup checks for large files/folders
- 🤖 Automated backup, prune, cache cleanup, and integrity check
- ♻️ Easy restore from any snapshot
- 🧩 Modular and extensible PowerShell codebase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- 💻 [PowerShell 7+](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
- 📦 [restic](https://restic.net/) (installed automatically if missing)
- 🗝️ [Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement) and [SecretStore](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore) modules

### Installation

Run the setup script as administrator:

```powershell
cd path\to\PSRBackup
.\setup\Install.ps1
```

This copies the module to your PowerShell modules folder and imports it.

### Usage

#### 🚀 Initialize a Repository

```powershell
Initialize-Repository -RepoPath "D:\Backups\ResticRepo"
```

#### 📦 Start a Backup
Excludes can be handled in the exclude file or by adding the file `.resticignore` to a directory.

```powershell
Start-Backup -RepoPath "D:\Backups\ResticRepo" -SourcePath "C:\Users\Jax\Documents" -ExcludeFile "config\exclude.txt"
```

#### ♻️ Restore a Backup

```powershell
Restore-Backup -RepoPath "D:\Backups\ResticRepo" -TargetPath "C:\Restore"
```

#### 🔐 Manage Passwords

- Save a password: `Set-ResticPassword -Name "ResticPassword_MyRepo"`
- Retrieve a password: `Get-ResticPassword -Name "ResticPassword_MyRepo"`
